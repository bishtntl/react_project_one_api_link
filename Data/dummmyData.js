       para:'A groundbreaking theoretical proof reveals that using a technique called overparametrization enhances performance in quantum machine learning for tasks that challenge traditional computers.We believe our results will be useful in using machine learning to learn the properties of quantum data, such as classifying different phases of matter in quantum materials research, which is very difficult on classical computers,” said Diego Garcia-Martin, a postdoctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He is a co-author of a new paper by a Los Alamos team on the technique in Nature Computational Science.',

       para:'UCLA researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery that could enhance the safety and efficiency of lithium-metal batteries. By preventing corrosion during the deposition of lithium, the researchers found that lithium atoms form a unique 12-sided shape, reducing the risk of explosions. This innovation could potentially revolutionize lithium battery technology, leading to improved safety and performance.',

       para:'Is it possible to see through a scattering medium such as ground glass? Traditionally, this would be considered impossible. When light passes through an opaque substance, the information carried within the light becomes “jumbled up”, almost as if undergoes complex encryption.Recently, a remarkable scientific breakthrough by Professor Choi Wonshik’s team from the IBS Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics (IBS CMSD) has unveiled a method to leverage this phenomenon in the fields of optical computing and machine learning.',

This advancement by the KU and Brookhaven team brings us nearer to generating pure hydrogen from renewable energy sources. This could potentially contribute to a more sustainable for the nation and the world.',

The move from its construction site to the flight line is one of many milestones that prepare the X-59 for its first and subsequent flights. Next up, the team will conduct significant ground tests to ensure the aircraft is safe to fly.
